# SLT-Data-Usage
This script can get your SLT data usage and display it in the system tray. This is mostly useful if you are using a unlimited package with daily limit.

Refresh interval is 120 secs, but it can easily be changed in the code.

You have to get some configs using Inspect Element option in the browser.
